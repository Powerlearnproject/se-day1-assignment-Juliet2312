Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
It enables the creation of software applications and systems that powers various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programing language
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
Advent of structured programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements
Design
Implementation

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing the software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer design and execute software tests in a qualitative manner.
Project Manager overseas the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDESs provide a comprehensive tool for writing, debugging and testing code e.g the Visual studio 
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among team members e.g GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements during the development cycle. This can be resolved by ensuring you continuously learning and exploration of software engineering and staying updated with emerging trends.
Tight deadlines to deliver software projects within the timeliness given and it can be overcomed by using the right methodologies which will be time saving.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing which tests individual components or modules of software
Integration testing which tests interactions from different subsystems.
System testing involves testing the entire systems.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me something
An improved prompt is more effective as it gives you more information on the prompt. An example of an improved vague prompt is, tell me the history of cats.
